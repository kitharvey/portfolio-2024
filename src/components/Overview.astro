    Hi, I'm <strong>Kit Harvey</strong>
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-primary">
    As a self-taught Front-End Developer based in the Philippines, I specialize
    in creating user-friendly, visually appealing, and efficient web
    experiences. My passion lies in blending design with development, combining
    my interests in graphic design, typography, and algorithms. This unique
    combination allows me to strike the perfect balance between creative
    expression and technical problem-solving.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-primary">
    Throughout my career, I've contributed to projects that demand meticulous
    attention to detail, user-centered design principles, and performance
    optimization. I actively seek opportunities to collaborate with teams that
    share my commitment to quality and innovation, working together to deliver
    impactful solutions that make a real difference.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-primary">
    Beyond coding, I maintain an active lifestyle through gym workouts and
    running, while cherishing time spent with friends and family. My dedication
    to self-improvement extends beyond technology, encompassing interests in
    philosophy, finance, and health. I firmly believe that continuous learning
    and personal growth are fundamental to both professional success and
    personal fulfillment.
